# SpringSecurityHelloWorldUsingAnnotation
Spring security app using annotation

This app demonstrates Spring Security 4 usage to secure a Spring MVC web application, securing URL access with authentication. We will use classic Hello World example to learn Spring Security 4 basics. This post uses Spring Annotation based configuration for Servlet 3.0 containers [thus no web.xml] and also shows corresponding XML based Security configuration for side-by-side comparison where applicable.

Steps to build and deploy this app :

1) mvn clean install

2) deploy .war file in tomcat 8.
